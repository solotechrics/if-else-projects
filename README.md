# Driving Eligibility Checker

This project is a simple web application that checks if a user is old enough to drive based on their age input. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive age verification tool.

## Project Description

The **Driving Eligibility Checker** allows users to input their age and check if they are eligible to drive. The app validates the input and provides feedback based on the age entered:

- If the user is 18 or older, it will confirm they are eligible to drive.
- If the user is younger than 18, it will inform them they are not eligible.
- If the input is invalid (non-numeric or empty), an error message will be displayed.

## Features
- Age input field where users can enter their age.
- Submit button to check eligibility.
- Display of eligibility status with clear feedback.
- Responsive design to work on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, using Flexbox for centering the content.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic to check the userâ€™s age and provide the correct feedback.
